  title: Why YogiTea
  description: >
    YogiTea is the tea for everyone who believes that great tea shouldn't just
    taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our leafs directly from
    small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the profits are
    reinvested in their communities.

  YogiTea is the ultimate spot for tea lovers who want to learn about their
  leaf’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take tea production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We sell green and roasted tea leafs that are sourced directly from

        variety of tea leafs grown with great care for the environment and local

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own leafs or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here to
        help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas to

        We believe that good tea has the power to bring people together. That’s
        why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting space
        where you can hang out with fellow tea lovers and learn about tea making
        techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for sale. The full
        price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our tea to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup. That’s
    why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the tea’s journey.
    We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are optimal for
    the plants, farmers and the local environment.
